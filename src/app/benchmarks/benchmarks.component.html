    <h3>Angha Project</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of the Angha Project is to generate C benchmarks out of open
      source repositories. To this end, we download programs from these
      repositories, split them into individual functions and reconstruct
      missing declarations to ensure that they compile. This page contains
      530K samples of programs that we have generated in this way. You can
      compile them all into object files using clang or gcc. Additionally,
      we provide all the machinery for those interested in producing
      more benchmarks. For comparison, we also provide actual C benchmarks,
      and synthetic programs produced by various benchmark generators. We
      have extracted feature vectors (59 different features) for all these
      benchmarks, in case the interested reader wants to use them to
      autotune compilers. The passes used in the extraction are:
      <i>
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;"> -mem2reg</span>
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;"> -O0</span>
        <a href="https://github.com/condekind/llvm-ep" target="_blank">
          <span style="white-space: nowrap;"> -VarCounter*</span>
          <span style="white-space: nowrap;"> -EdgeCounter*</span>
        </a>
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;"> -stats</span>
      </i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We provide charts relating different characteristics of the
      benchmarks available in this page. Inside each collection featured
      on the "Available Benchmarks" section, click the 'data analysis'
      link to have access to them. These charts show relations between
      the following program features:
